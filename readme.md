# sublime-text-themes
My favourite Sublime themes

Both themes were edited by me, original copies can be found inside of `original/`

### Installation
`./install.sh`

This will run a very simple script i created in 15 minutes that creates 2 directories under the configuration folder and copies each theme inside, don't trust this script with your life.

Sorry for the bad preview pictures, i'm busy
